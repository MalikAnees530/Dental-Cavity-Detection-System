# ü¶∑ Dental Cavity Detection System

## Overview
The **Dental Cavity Detection System** is an advanced AI-powered tool designed to analyze dental X-ray images and detect cavities with high accuracy. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), this project provides an efficient and reliable diagnostic solution for dental professionals.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- **AI-Driven Analysis:** Utilizes a custom-trained CNN to identify cavities in X-ray images.
- **Input Support:** Accepts JPG, PNG, and DICOM file formats.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Features a web-based platform with drag-and-drop upload and an "Analyze Image" button.
- **Confidence Scoring:** Provides a confidence score with each detection result.
- **Real-Time Results:** Delivers instant feedback to enhance workflow efficiency.

## üíª Technical Details
- **Backend:** Developed using Python with the Flask framework and PyTorch for model inference.
- **Model Architecture:** A CNN with convolutional and fully connected layers, optimized for X-ray analysis.
- **Preprocessing:** Includes image resizing and tensor transformation for model compatibility.
- **Deployment:** Hosted locally with a debug port (5000) for testing.

## üöÄ How to Use
1. Upload a dental X-ray image (JPG, PNG, or DICOM) via the web interface.
2. Click the "Analyze Image" button to initiate detection.
3. Receive a detailed result indicating the presence of a cavity and confidence level.
4. To open the frontend page, navigate to the `index` file in VS Code and run it to display the interface.
